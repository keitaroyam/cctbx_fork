lbfgs.f   original Fortran code
sdrive.f  original Fortran test driver

lbfgs.pyf                  pyfort interface file
pyfort.py                  trivial pyfort driver
build_lbfgs_extension.csh  script for compiling and linking pyfort Python bindings
tst_fortran_lbfgs.py       Python port of test driver (sdrive.f)

2003-05-13:
  tst_fortran_lbfgs.py works correctly under Tru64 Unix (Alpha chip)
  using Python 2.2.1, Numeric 21.0 and Pyfort-7.0b2.
  A test with the exact same source code fails under Redhat 8.0
  using /usr/bin/python (Python 2.2.1, Numeric 23.0). The reason
  for the failure is unknown.
