the output will also contain the original (not unique) hkl for each
reflection. This is designed for MAD/local scaling work. The
original index modifier only works with the default INCLUDE
NO PARTIALS. The output will consist of the original hkl, unique
hkl, batch number, a flag (0 = centric, 1 = I+, 2 = I-), another flag
(0 = hkl reflecting above the spindle, 1 = hkl reflecting below the
spindle), the asymmetric unit of the reflection, I (scaled, Lorentz
and Polarization corrected), and the s of I. The format is
(6i4, i6, 2i2, i3, 2f8.1).
