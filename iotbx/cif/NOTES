The files cifParser.py and cifLexer.py are generated from the file cif.g
using antlr-3.1.2.jar
The files cif2Parser.{h,c} and cif2Lexer.{h,c} are generated from the file
cif2.g using antlr-3.2.jar

cif2Parser.c and cif2Lexer.c should then be renamed to *.cpp

an example batch file for Windows could be:

set CLASSPATH=.;C:\antlr\antlr-3.1.2\lib\antlr-3.1.2.jar
java org.antlr.Tool cif.g

or for Unix:

/usr/bin/env CLASSPATH=/net/cci/auto_build/repositories/antlr-3.1.2.jar java org.antlr.Tool cif.g

The required anltr jar files can be obtained from:
  http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.1.2.jar
  http://www.antlr.org/download/antlr-3.2.jar

The runtime libraries and associated files required to build and run the
generated parsers are to be obtained from the antlr3 folder included in
the cctbx source bundles available from
  http://cci.lbl.gov/cctbx_build/all.html
