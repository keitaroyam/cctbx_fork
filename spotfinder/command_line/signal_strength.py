def run(args, command_name="distl.signal_strength"):
  help_str="""explanation:
Local background and background standard deviation are determined.
Pixels are classified as signal if > minimum_signal_height sigmas above background.
Signals are chosen as spot maxima if > minimum_spot_height sigmas above background.
Spots are grown around the maxima, and retained if they fit minimal area criteria.
Total number of candidates at this stage is reported as "Spot Total"
Ice rings are eliminated by at least two different algorithms (rings of high pixel
  values and rings of high spot count).
Resolution filters are applied if given on the command line.
Total number of candidates at this stage is reported as "In-Resolution Total"
Other spot-quality filters are applied to give the number of "Good Bragg Candidates".
Method 1 Resolution is a published legacy algorithm (Zhang et al, 2006) no longer used.
Method 2 Resolution reflects drop off of spot count as a function of resolution shell,
  but is overridden by command line input of distl.res.outer
Signal strength of the Good Bragg Candidates is then presented as integrated area of
  the spot above local background, expressed in pixel-analog/digital units.
Very verbose output is available by setting distl.verbose=True
