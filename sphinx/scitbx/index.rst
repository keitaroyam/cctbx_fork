scitbx - general-purpose scientific functions
=============================================

The ``scitbx`` module is intended as a general-purpose library for scientific
computing, similar to NumPy+SciPy but with a C++ foundation (and free of any
FORTRAN code).  It contains most functionality not explicitly related to
crystallography or molecular structure, including a C++ array family, the
LBFGS minimizer, a 1D/3D Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) library, code for
working with matrix operations, and many mathematical utilities.
