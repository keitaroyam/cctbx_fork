Before committing changes please be sure to complete the following steps.

********************
libtbx.check_clutter
********************

To avoid problems with platform-specific end-of-line conventions
and stray whitespace characters such as tabs (see below) run the
command

  libtbx.find_clutter

at the top level of each svn or cvs directory with changes to be
committed. The command will recursively traverse all subdirectories
and list the names of files that are not "clean."  To minimize
the chance of accidents, libtbx.find_clutter does not modify
the files listed. A convenient option for cleaning up the problem
files is to use the libtbx.clean_clutter command, e.g.:

  libtbx.clean_clutter path/to/file

One can also issue

  libtbx.clean_clutter -c

which will recursively clean those files under the current directory which are modified or added, i.e. which would be committed.

To convert files with Windows or Macintosh end-of-line conventions
use the command:

  libtbx.any2unix path/to/file

# Why do we need libtbx.find_clutter?
#
#   We want to have an easy and reliable way to see who changed what exactly.
#
#   cctbx and phenix developers use many different editors. Some
#   remove trailing whitespace, some insert tabs, etc. Without
#   libtbx.clean_clutter we'd have a hard time seeing what was
#   actually changed since we'd have many spurious diffs in the
#   history.
#   (diff -b -w helps, but it hides indentation changes.)

Miscellaneous guidelines
************************

Please use 2-space indentation throughout
-----------------------------------------
  It is extremely tedious to re-factor code written by authors
  using inconsistent indentation.

Please break lines if they are longer than 80 characters
--------------------------------------------------------
  This will help make the sources more readable in various situations
  (e.g. svn web view). Occasional longer lines are fine, e.g. for
  certain assertions.
  (Why 80 and not some other number? -- Obviously there has to be
  *some* limit. 80 was chosen because it fits universally.)

Please use only absolute Python imports
---------------------------------------
  Reasons:
    - Scripts with relative imports cannot be moved to other locations.
    - Python's relative import mechanism easily leads to confusion.
  Good example:
    from iotbx import reflection_file_reader
  Bad example:
    import reflection_file_reader

Please do not use import *
--------------------------
  Reason:
    - Reading code using import * is very difficult because
      there is no easy way to tell where symbols come from.
    - Name clashes may lead to subtle bugs.
  Good example:
    from iotbx import mtz
    mtz_object = mtz.object(file_name="any.mtz")
  Bad example:
    from iotbx.mtz import *
    # name clash: built-in object, iotbz.mtz.object

Please use except KeyboardInterrupt in combination with bare excepts
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reason:
    - A bare except will "swallow" keyboard interrupts (Ctrl-C),
      forcing the user to hit Ctrl-C multiple times.
  Good example:
    try:
      something()
    except KeyboardInterrupt: raise
    except:
      pass
  Bad example:
    try:
      something()
    except:
      pass
