This README is somewhat of a temporary document while this code is
developed, before it is incorporated into the CCTBX build system.

Here we are transferring code from the bpcx_regression repository that
deals with the detector model, and translating it into C++. Following
this, Python bindings will be made and the tests in the original code
will be run, leaning on the C++ classes. Finally, the BPCX Use Case
code will be modified to use the detector model.

That, at least, is a statement of intention. 

At this moment, a trivial test can be compiled with something similar to
the following (from a top level build directory):

cctbx.python ../sources/cctbx_project/libtbx/configure.py rstbx
libtbx.scons ./rstbx/bpcx/tst_sensor

and run using its dispatcher

rstbx.tst_sensor

All this does is print '100' if it works, which is fairly obscure. But
this test is not going to persist. Next step is to get the Python
bindings for the sensor class, then use it in the Python tests already
written in the bpcx_regression/detector_model repository
